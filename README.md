ArguX is an advanced OSINT tool designed for gathering and analyzing publicly available camera feeds. It connects to publicly available sources like Insecam, applies object detection using YOLOv11 models to identify objects such as cars, people, and more, then visualizes the results through an intuitive web interface.

ArguX is a significant evolution from my previous project [EagleEye](https://github.com/erfangolpour/EagleEye), which was a command-line tool using YOLOv4. While EagleEye laid the groundwork, ArguX completely reimagines the concept with a modern architecture, web interface, and significantly expanded functionality.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.10+**
-   **Node.js 18+** and npm
-   **Redis** server
-   **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/erfangolpour/argux.git
    cd argux
    ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Redis Setup

1. Install Redis server:

    **On Ubuntu/Debian:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install redis-server
    sudo systemctl enable redis-server
    ```

    **On macOS (using Homebrew):**

    ```bash
    brew install redis
    brew services start redis
    ```

    **For other platforms, please refer to the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/download).**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The backend settings can be configured in `backend/settings.py`:

-   Adjust Redis connection settings (`redis_host`, `redis_port`, `redis_db`)
-   Configure YOLO model settings (`default_model`, `yolo_base_dir`)
-   Set maximum concurrent tasks (`max_concurrent_tasks`)
-   Modify CORS settings for development/production environments

You can also create a `.env` file in the backend directory to override any settings:

```
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=5
DEFAULT_MODEL=yolo11m.pt
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Running Services Manually

1. Start the Redis server (if not already running as a service):

    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

2. Start the Backend API (from the backend directory):

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

3. Start the Celery worker (from the backend directory):

    ```bash
    celery -A main.celery_app worker
    ```

4. Start the Frontend development server (from the frontend directory):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Running with tmux (Linux/macOS)

For convenience, a `run.sh` script is provided that uses tmux to run all services in a single terminal window:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This will create a tmux session with separate panes for the backend API, Celery worker, and frontend development server.

### Running on Windows

While ArguX is not officially tested on Windows, it should be possible to run with proper configuration:

1. Ensure Redis is installed and running (through WSL or Windows binary)
2. Start each service in a separate command prompt:
    - Backend API: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`
    - Celery worker: `celery -A main.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo`
    - Frontend: `npm run dev`

## üîÆ Future Directions

ArguX is continuously evolving. Planned features include:

-   **Data Export**: Capability to export results in various formats
-   **Persistent Database**: Storage system for scan results for easy recall and historical analysis
-   **Custom Object Detection**: Add custom objects to the detection model by re-training YOLO
-   **Better Backend-Celery Synchronization**: Improve communication and avoid busy loops
-   **Optional Redis**: Make Redis an optional dependency by allowing Celery to manage threads directly
-   **Additional Sources**: Integration with more camera sources (Shodan, Censys, Criminal IP, ZoomEye, public highway indexes, etc.)

## üí° Debugging Tools

While not a requirement, [Flower](https://github.com/mher/flower) is an excellent open-source tool for monitoring and managing Celery clusters. To use it:

```bash
pip install flower
celery -A main.celery_app flower
```

This provides a web interface at `http://localhost:5555` for monitoring task execution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Ethics

### Technical Limitations

It's important to understand that object detection models have inherent limitations. While YOLO is effective at identifying common objects like cars, people, or animals, it has limitations:

-   Even the smallest YOLO models, despite being extremely efficient and fast, still need processing time, especially given the scale at which ArguX operates
-   Detection accuracy is dependent on feed quality, lighting conditions, and distance
-   Results should always be verified by a human

Contrary to popular belief, facial recognition is significantly more demanding than object detection and is simply not feasible at the current resolution of public camera feeds. So to answer the frequently asked question: this tool cannot be used to find specific people.

### Ethical Considerations

ArguX connects to camera feeds that are accessible through public directories like Insecam, which may include:

-   Cameras with default credentials that haven't been changed
-   Improperly secured camera feeds
-   Cameras intentionally made public by their owners

It's important to understand that while these feeds are accessible to the average user through directory websites, this doesn't always mean they were intentionally made public by their owners. When using ArguX:

-   Respect privacy and legal regulations in your jurisdiction
-   Do not use for surveillance or monitoring individuals
-   Do not share or publish content that contains private or sensitive information

Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use of ArguX complies with all applicable laws and ethical standards.
